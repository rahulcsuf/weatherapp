# weatherapp
A real time weather reporting chatbot.
The chatbot uses RASA NLU model for interaction in natural language and intent extraction. It then uses RASA core to pick up the correct action and get the real time weather data using API calls and use it to satisfy user query. Finally, this integrates to Slack as a bot.
